# Becoming more productive

We waste much of our time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach our true goals. What if you placed a high value on your time?
Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.

## "Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness

It takes discipline to not become “busy.”
If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.
This is how lives are wasted — by doing thankless work for ungrateful takers that didn’t deserve your time in the first place.
“The most successful people are not busy. They’re focused.”

## Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy

Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.

Deep work means absolutely not tolerating distractions and producing monumental quality and quantity in a very short time. This is how you can complete far more with focused efforts than unfocused efforts with far more time.
