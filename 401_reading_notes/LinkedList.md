# Linked List

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link. There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly.

## Terminology

Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

Head - The Head is a reference type of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

Current - The Current reference is a reference type of type Node that is currently being looked at. This node is traditionally used when traversing through a full linked list. When traversing, you typically reset the current to the head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

## Linear data structure
One characteristic of linked lists is that they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. We can think of a linear data structure like a game of hopscotch: in order to get to the end of the list, we have to go through all of the items in the list in order, or sequentially. Linear structures, however, are the opposite of non-linear structures. In non-linear data structures, items donâ€™t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.
