# Images (406-427)


**Controlling images size**

**aligning images in css**

Rather than using the <img> element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:
1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image (such as the small class in our example).
2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

**centering images**

By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block. Once it has been made into a 
block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:
1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

**Backgorund images**

**Repeating images**

repeat: The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically

repeat-x: The image is repeated horizontally only

repeat-y: The image is repeated vertically only.

no-repeat: The image is only shown once.

fixed: The background image stays in the same position on the page.

scroll: The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

**background position**

**shorthand background**

The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property. The properties must be specified in the following order, but you
can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.
1. background-color
2. background-image
3. background-repeat
4. background-attachment
5. background-position

**images rollover and spirits**

Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a
rollover) and a third style when they click on it.

**CSS3 gradient**

CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for
the background of a box. The gradient is created using the
background-image property and, at the time of writing,
different browsers required a different syntax.

**contrast of background images**

If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low
contrast in order for the text to be legible.
