# Creating animated chart with chart.js

**Charts Benefits**

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

**start using charts**

A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

**Setting up Chart.js**

first download chart.js then Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script by using <\script src='Chart.min.js'><\/script>.This will allow us to create pie, line, bar charts



**Conclusion**

The great things about Chart.js are that it’s simple to use and really very flexible. Plus, once you’ve mastered the basics here, you’ll discover that there are tons of options **listed in the documentation.**
