# CSS Layouts

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

## Element Positioning

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: **normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and fixed positioning**. To control overlaping elements **z-index** is used. **float** property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible or to stack block elements beside each other.The **clear** property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand sides of a box.
