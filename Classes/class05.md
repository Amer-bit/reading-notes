 attribute the src attribute which indicate to the source(URL) of the images this source can be locally or from the internet and the second attribute is **Alt** which describe the image **if you cant see it**
 we can add a third attribute called title to provide a title for the image. The height of the image can be specified using **height and width properties** and the **align property** float the image horizantally to the **left or to the right** and float it vertically using **top, bottom and middle**

 **Image Location**

 Image should be placed in a three ways:
 1. before a paragraph: The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.
 2. inside the start of a paragraph: The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.
 3. in the middle of a paragraph: The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.
